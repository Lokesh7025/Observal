"""Re-checking who may still read an item.

Authorization is resolved when an item is written, which is correct at that
instant. Two things can change afterwards, and both have to be caught:

* the reader's membership can be revoked, so someone removed from a teamspace
  must stop reading a private component's name out of their inbox;
* the SUBJECT can be made private, so an item written when a listing was public
  must stop being readable by people who cannot see the listing now.

The second is why ``is_private_subject`` on the row is not consulted for
anything that has a listing table. It records what was true at write time, and a
listing flipped to private afterwards would still be described by its rows as
public. Visibility is therefore resolved against the CURRENT listing.
